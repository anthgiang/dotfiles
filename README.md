# Dotfiles

My personal minimalistic dotfiles.

tmux, vim, zsh.

#### Requirements:
- zsh shell (macOS Catalina).
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions).

#### Usage:

1. Clone this repository somewhere on your machine.

The following command will create and clone into a `~/.dotfiles` directory.

```
 git clone https://github.com/anthgiang/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

2. Execute the script `dotfiles_setup.sh`.

This script will symlink all dotfiles to the home folder.

```
~/.dotfiles/dotfiles_setup.sh
```

3. Now start a new terminal session.

This step will solace your soul.
